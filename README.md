# MakeMyTrip Data Pipeline

This project implements a data pipeline for extracting, transforming, and visualizing hotel data from the MakeMyTrip website. The pipeline consists of several components:

1. **Data Extraction**: Selenium is used to scrape hotel data from the MakeMyTrip website.
2. **Data Transformation and Processing**: Apache Spark is employed to process and transform the extracted hotel datasets.
3. **Database Integration**: The processed data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
4. **Data Visualization**: Plotly is used to create interactive data visualizations in Jupyter notebooks.
